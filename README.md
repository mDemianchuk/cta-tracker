## Description
__CTA Tracker__ is a multi-platform mobile application for the Chicago Transit Authority bus and train tracking. 
This app utilizes two microservices â€“ [CTA Train Tracker Service](https://github.com/mDemianchuk/cta-train-tracker-service) 
and [CTA Bus Tracker Service](https://github.com/mDemianchuk/cta-bus-tracker-service) that are gateways for 
the official CTA [Train](https://www.transitchicago.com/developers/traintracker/) and [Bus](https://www.transitchicago.com/developers/bustracker/) Tracker APIs. 
The user can see arrival times for any bus or train stop and save it to their Favorite Stops to have easy access to it.
